//Double slashes - comment 
Debug.Log("Hello"); - these print to the console

integer varibles are called int,then we name them starting with a lowercase letter
ex. int myAgeIs



if statements

// is looking for a key to be pressed and will upload it into the console
EX. if (Input. GetKeyDown("up"))
      {
        Debug.Log(" YoU'vE pReSsEd ThE uP kEy")
      {
      
      /resetting a varible to a new value
      maxGuess= guess;
      
      //recalcuting guess average based on new numbers
      guess= (minGuess + maxGuess) / 2;
